Usually LaTeX is already installed in Linux, but I installed TexLive -
mostly full LaTeX distributive from http://tug.org/texlive

After installation you'll need to tune it ( see
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-ru/texlive-ru.html#x1-300003.4 ).

To create PDF from TEX file use pdflatex command. To learn about LaTeX
syntax see e.g. http://www.inp.nsk.su/~baldin/LaTeX/lurs.pdf

To find & view TeX documentation use texdoc command.

PLEASE COMPILE TWICE BEFORE PRINTING!
